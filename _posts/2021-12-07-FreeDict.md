title: Extras from FreeDict
---

[FreeDict][2] project provides seven Latin dictionaries, such as Finnish-Latin or Ducth-Latin, which were added to the [Extras](/list_general.html#extras) list in General section.

Some of these wordbooks are sufficiently big and contain 10,000 words or more. Pick Latin language from the [drop-down list][1] on the project's official website to find information about every dictionary.
