### [Lexicon Latinum, Wagner (1878)][1] v2.3

- **add:** all parts of the Latin-French dictionary

I decided to include all parts of the main Latin-French dictionary (1-15 of 18), even though some of them have not finished F2 round. There are about 1500 formatting errors, but it is expected for WIP project.

Anyway, I think it is very useful even in this draft state. If you encounter an error, use links to open this article on Archive.org (only in "slob" format).
