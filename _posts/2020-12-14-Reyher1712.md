### [Theatrum Latino-Germanico-Graecum, Reyher (1712)][1] v0.3

- **fix**: multiple errors
- **add**: semantic markup to some articles
- **change**: link to the Sachsen-Anhalt copy

I am fixing errors in the transcript of the dictionary, but it still needs a systematic and consecutive proofing.

[Download][2] from GitHub.
