# Dictionary shells

The dictionaries on this site are encoded as database files. To work with them, you'll need to first load them into a dictionary shell application. Your shell options will vary according to the device you use.

## Desktop

There are many good dictionary shell options for desktop, and we publish our files in **MDict**, **Slob**, **StartDict**, and **XDF** for broad compatibility.

If you don't already have a preferred dictionary shell, we recommend **GoldenDict**. This free, open-source app works on Windows, Linux, and macOS, and it supports a variety of formats (though we recommend using **Slob** files from this site). Reliable and easy to use, it's the best dictionary app we know of for working with Latin.

For information on installing and configuring GoldenDict, see ["Quick Start"]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/howto.md %}).

## Mobile

These options are more limited. No single mobile app that we've tried combines superior search, interface, and file support. Below is a list of shell apps that should work with our dictionary files, but none receives our full endorsement:

* [Aard 2](http://aarddict.org/) (Android) — open source. Supports only **Slob** files.
* [Alpus](https://alpusapp.com/index.html) (Android, iOS) — commercial, with a free version that allows up to 5 active dictionaries. Somewhat confusing interface, but supports many formats. (Use with **StarDict** or **XDXF** files from this site.)
* [GoldenDict Mobile](http://goldendict.mobi/) (Android) — commercial, with a free version that allows up to 5 active dictionaries. (Use with **StarDict** files from this site.)
* [BlueDict](http://www.ssdlsoft.com/bluedict/) (Android) — Chinese application (see on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.ssdl.bluedict)) supporting only **MDict** format. However, it has morphology search (read ["Hunspell"]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/hunspell.md %}) for details).

You can find more information about mobile dictionary apps in [this discussion](https://github.com/nikita-moor/latin-dictionary/issues/2). If you need a file format that you can't find on this site, please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.md %}).
