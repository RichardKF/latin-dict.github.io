# {{ page.title }}, {{ page.author }} ({{ page.year }})

**Latin** headwords are explained in both **Latin** and **German** languages. In spite of the word "Graecum" in the book's title, Greek text was not transcribed, so our computer dictionary is only Latin-German.

Total number of the articles is estimated to be 40000.

# States and limitations

Transcript made by the HAB Wolfenbüttel lacks for semantic mark-up, so currently we could only draft headers. Paragraphs belonging to the same articles should be joined, but it requires manual proofing. In the future, we hope to add Greek text and mark up German words.
