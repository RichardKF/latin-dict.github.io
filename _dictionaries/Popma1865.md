Full title is "Ausonii Popmae frisii de differentiis verborum cum additamentis Ioannis Friderici Hekelii, Adami Danielis Richteri, Ioannis Christiani Messerschmidii et Thomae Vallaurii qui opus diligentissime retractavit".

Dictionary of **Latin** synonyms ("osculum" vs "suavium"), homonyms ("arundo" vs "hirundo") or paronymous words ("cedere" vs "accedere") with explanations in **Latin**. One pair of Greek words is discussed (Ἔπαινος vs Ἐγκώμιον). There are sparse Greek, Italian, French and German sentences.

Grammatical treatise "De usu antiquae locutionis" is an independent Popma's book, but in XVII-XVIII centuries it was often published together with "De differentiis verborum". It is not included into our edition.
