Full title: "Vademecum in opus Saxonis et alia opera Danica compendium ex indice verborum".

The first editions of this Medieval Latin vocabulary was published in 1931 by Franz Blatt (1903-1979). Reimer Hemmingsen (1922-1998) made new edition in 1997, in which he corrected and expanded articles (RH notes), and introduced new words (® sign).

Being written completely in Latin (with rare Danish and German glosses), this dictionary can be recommended to every Latin learner (pay attention to Usage notes). For example:

- **lacrima**, -æ i.q. humor ex oculis emanans
- **cruor**, -is de sanguine effuso
- **fenestra**, -æ i. foramen parietis per quod lux immittitur

Dictionary is [available on-line](http://www.rostra.dk/latin/).

## Usage notes

This dictionary is dedicated to Danish literature, so "lingua nostra" means "lingua Danica".

The letter "ø" (slashed O) is used in spelling of Latin words, such as "obødio" (oboedio) or prølio (proelio). It was more frequent in the edition of 1996, and was almost everywhere replaced with "oe" in 1997, but some remnants still exist.

In the course of evolution from Classic to Medieval Latin, most of the words preserved their meaning, such as "puella" (girl) or "amor" (love), but some changed it to more specific, so "abdomen" (belly) became "fat" and "acceptio" (receiving) became "reputation", or were adapted to local culture, so "crustula" took meaning of "frustum glacie" and "clava" is "malleus Thor dei". Also, grammar of sentences may not corresponds to the Classic Latin.
