**English-Latin** dictionary containing about 27,000 of articles. It is based on the transcript of Distributed Proofreaders (see Sources) which is not finished yet, so about 50% of the articles have still not been formatted.

Another digital edition of this dictionary was made by Johan Winge (@Alatius). His version is available on-line on the website [Latinitium][11] and should be recommended to all users because of its completeness.
