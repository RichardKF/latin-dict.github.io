**English-Latin** dictionary containing about 27,000 of articles. It is based on the transcript of Distributed Proofreaders (see Sources) which is not finished yet, so about 65% of the articles have still not been formatted. Therefore, do not inform me, please, about errors in the text, it will change a lot in the near future.

Another digital edition of this dictionary was made by Johan Winge (@Alatius). His version is available on-line on the website [Latinitium][11].
