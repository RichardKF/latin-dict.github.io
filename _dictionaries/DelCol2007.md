The book "Diccionario auxiliar español-latino para el uso moderno del latín" was compiled by José Juan Del Col (1925-2018), former rector of El Instituto Superior "Juan XXIII" de Bahía Blanca (Argentina). It contains some general lexis, though does not have such frequent words as "andar" or "comer", and is aimed at more specialized terms of the modern life.

# States and limitations

Keywords are duplicated with their equivalents after removing diacritics, e.g. "lingüística" > "linguistica", for convenience. Placeholders, such as "un cuarto de -", where replaced with the headwords, "un cuarto de _hora_", where it was possible to do automatically.
