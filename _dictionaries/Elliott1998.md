# {{ page.title }}, {{ page.author }} ({{ page.year }})

A compilation of abbreviations found in Latin epigraphy and assembled from digital texts of all Latin inscriptions published in L'Année Épigraphique between 1888 and 1993.

It **is not** a list of abbreviations used in texts, such as "e.g." or "v.g.", but acronyms found in lapidary inscriptions, such as steles or gravestones.
